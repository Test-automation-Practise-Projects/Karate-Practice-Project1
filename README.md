# Karate Beginner Tutorials

This repository is my personal project aimed at helping me learn the basic concepts of Karate API testing. It includes samples for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE API testing.


## Project Overview

In this repository, I am compiling resources from the [Karate Beginner Tutorial Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhW3qG5bs-L-y5Q1zDXJAur1JNZVFB534). The playlist contains a series of instructional videos that cover fundamental Karate concepts, techniques, and practical examples.

### Purpose

The goal is to:

- **Learn**: Understand the basic principles and functionalities of Karate.
- **Practice**: Apply the knowledge gained from the tutorials in real-world testing scenarios.
- **Document**: Keep track of my learning journey and any notes or examples I find helpful.
