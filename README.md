# API Operations with Reqres and JSONPlaceholder

This repository contains a collection of API operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using the following APIs:

- [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in): A hosted REST API for testing and prototyping.
- [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com): A free fake online REST API for testing and prototyping.

This project uses **Cucumber** with Gherkin syntax to define scenarios that test CRUD operations on the above APIs. The primary objective is to validate that the API returns the expected results for various requests.
